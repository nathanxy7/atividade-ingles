# Technical Guide: Installing and Running

## Introduction

[Breve descrição da aplicação e do propósito do guia]

## Prerequisites

Node.js (version 18 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
Visual Studio Code (or another code editor)
Web browser (e.g., Google Chrome or Firefox)

## Step-by-Step Installation



Step 1 - Paste Link in the terminal

We copied the GitHub link and navigated to the folder through the terminal, where we opened it and entered the command:

```
git clone (copied link)

```


Step 2 - Activity folder

Open the activities folder in the terminal.After copying with git clone, we will use the command:

```
cd (folder name)

```

To open the desired folder to install npm



Step 3 - install NPM 

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows programmers to share and reuse code, as well as efficiently manage project dependencies. With over a million packages in its registry, NPM is the largest software repository in the world.

After getting a brief overview of NPM and opening the folder, let's move on to installing NPM through the code:

```
npm install

```

then just wait for it to install



Step 4 - Run Code

After doing all of this, and checking if NPM installed without errors, let's run the code in the browser using the following command:

```
npm run dev

```

A host link will appear where you just need to ctrl + click (with the left mouse button) and it will go straight to the browser with the code running.
